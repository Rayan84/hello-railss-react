# Blog Application

> This project is a simple but very comprehensive rails application, it relies on an API to retrieve data in the form of JSON, then it renders a random greeting message each time the user reloads the page. The application demonstrates a wide range of powerful programming tools like React, Redux, Rails, API consumption and others.
